Ayuta is named after ancient Indian Kingdom of Ayuta, which some say is present day Ayodhya, or more likely, Ay kindom ofof ancient Tamilakam, what is modern day Tamilnadu in India. In 1st Century C.E., Princess of Ayuta Semvalam a.k.a Suriratna,sailed to Korean Peninsula in a big boat, married King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya, and became Empress Boju (보주태후). She carried with her Pandyan language and culture, so many Tamil words are now part of Korean Vocabulary.

This font is created by an Indian font designer, to commomorate 2000 yrs of cultural relation between India and Korea initiated by Princess of Ayuta.

A simplistic design is planned with Jamos created with mostly rectangular components.
